    "As we will see in class, the long wavelengths of radio emission make it difficult to obtain images at high spatial resolution. Spatial resolution can be improved by combining the signal from multiple telescopes to create a telescope with an effective resolution set by the distance between the telescopes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider two radio telescopes, separated by a distance $u$ in the East-West direction and $v$ in the North-South direction. The signals from these two telescopes are multiplied to create an interference pattern. The amplitude and phase of this interference pattern is then recorded. This process is repeated for each pair of antennas within an array of radio telescopes, resulting in a map of the *visibilities* ($V(u,v)$) as a function of the $u$ and $v$ separations of the different antennas. These visibilities are related to the intensity via: \n",
    "\n",
    "$V(u,v) = \\int I(l,m)\\exp[-i2\\pi(ul+vm)]dldm$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $I(l,m)$ represents the intensity distribution across the sky and $l$ and $m$ are the position on the sky (angular distance from the center of the image). We will discuss in class more about how this equation arises from the interference pattern. The intensity pattern (i.e., the image on the sky) can be obtained by inverting this equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$I(l,m) = \\int V(u,v)\\exp[i2\\pi(ul+vm)]dudv$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we have a limited number of antennas, the visibilities are only measured at certain values of $u$ and $v$. This has important consequences for the images that are reconstructed from the visibilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of you may recognize these equations as those of a two-dimensional Fourier Transform (to go from intensity to visibilities, with an inverse Fourier transform to go from visibilities to intensity). The purpose of this lab, and the subsequent lectures, is *not* to teach you how to take a Fourier Transform (Phys 210 can do that), but instead to help you get an intuition for how the information in an image is stored within the visibilities, and how the positions of the antennas affects the images that are reconstructed from the visibilities. One important takeaway from this lab is the fact that an image is *not* the primary data product from a radio interferometer, and there is some level of processing that is necessary in order to create an image. This has important consequences for what can and cannot be seen in an image."
